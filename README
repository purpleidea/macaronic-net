Hello!

This is the "web" source code for http://macaronic.net/
It is an excuse to try out twitter-bootstrap and google-appengine.
Please feel free to send me patches, or point out errors and improvements.
All my code is AGPLv3+, if you feel like using it as a base for your own site.
Some included upstream code is under different licenses.
Happy hacking,

James
